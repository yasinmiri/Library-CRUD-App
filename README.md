Introduction
This document provides comprehensive information on setting up the project, configuring the database, understanding the API endpoints, testing procedures, and accessing the project on GitHub.

Technologies Used
Spring Framework: Used to build the API, providing an architecture.
H2 Database: A database used for development and testing.
Postman: Used to test API endpoints during development.
JUnit: Employed for writing unit tests to ensure the reliability of the code.
JMeter: Utilized for performance testing to evaluate the API's scalability and responsiveness.
GitHub: Version control system for managing and sharing the source code.

Setting Up the Project
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the application.

Database Configuration
API uses an H2 database for development and testing. The database configuration details can be found in the application.properties file.

API Endpoints
The API provides the following CRUD endpoints:
Create: POST /api/resource
Read: GET /api/resource
Update: PUT /api/resource
Delete: DELETE /api/resource
For detailed information on request and response formats, please refer to the API Documentation.

Unit Testing
Unit tests have been implemented to validate the functionality of each endpoint. 

Performance Testing
Performance tests have been conducted using JMeter to assess the API's scalability and responsiveness.

GitHub Repository
The source code for this project is available on GitHub.
